# SUPER WAVEXE!
A little wavetable synthesizer optimized to make tiny executable music files.

An upgrade of wavexe (https://github.com/protodomemusic/wavexe). Oh you better get ready, because this time wavecycles are algorithmically generated (more memory, but smaller executable) and waveforms are calculated as floats (which conceptually simplifies things). Also, currently, tables are populated using FM synthesis (wow), and oscillators get resonant low-pass filters for additional squelch (fantastic).

## Update 21/08/22
No sequencing or anything yet, will add build instructions when there's a semblance of usefulness to the code.
